### Statistical Analysis for Energy Efficiency

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and develops regression models to predict **heating** and **cooling loads** in buildings based on their features. Using **R**, the project explores data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques to identify factors influencing energy efficiency.

#### Key Steps:
1. **EDA**: Inspect and preprocess data, visualize distributions, and analyze correlations.
2. **Regression Modeling**: Build **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**, **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**, and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** models to predict energy loads.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and diagnostic checks.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Use **Mann-Whitney U Test** and **Kruskal-Wallis Test** to assess differences in energy loads based on building characteristics.

#### Outcome:
The project identifies key factors affecting energy consumption and develops accurate predictive models for improving energy efficiency in buildings.
